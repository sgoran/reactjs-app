# reactjs-app
Small ReactJS application with user login and dashboard updates with websockets.

Application was done as a job test so I can't reveal company update API. 
Instead I simulated set of metrics and websocket updates.

I used [ReactJS](https://github.com/facebook/react) + [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) 
and a few smaller modules for cookie and date managment.

For the UI, [react-mdl](https://github.com/tleunen/react-mdl) is used. A ReactJS
port of [Google Material Design Lite](http://www.getmdl.io/)

I hope it will help someone, because I searched for examples of React applications
with login, auth and other common problems.
Also it's a nice way to use ReactJS with material design.
